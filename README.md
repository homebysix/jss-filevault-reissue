> [!WARNING]
> **DEPRECATION NOTICE**: **[Escrow Buddy](https://github.com/macadmins/escrow-buddy) is a better tool for reissuing and escrowing FileVault keys which does NOT require prompting users for their passwords.** As such, I don't plan to make any further updates to the workflow below. Please strongly consider switching to Escrow Buddy. Read more below:

## The Problem

__FileVault individual recovery keys can be missing from the JSS for many reasons.__

- Perhaps the Mac was encrypted prior to enrollment.
- The Mac was encrypted prior to the FileVault redirection profile installation.
- The original recovery key was lost for some reason (e.g. database corruption or a bug of some kind).

## The Solution

__You can use a policy to generate a new FileVault key and upload to JSS.__

1. A configuration profile ensures that all FileVault keys are escrowed with the JSS.
2. A smart group determines which computers lack valid individual recovery keys.
3. Customize the __reissue_filevault_recovery_key.sh__ for your environment.
4. Create a policy that deploys the __reissue_filevault_recovery_key.sh__ script to the computers in the smart group.

### Step One: Configuration Profile

__A configuration profile called “Redirect FileVault keys to JSS” does what the name says.__

- General
    - Distribution Method: __Install Automatically__
    - Level: __Computer Level__
- FileVault Recovery Key Redirection
    - __Automatically redirect recovery keys to the JSS__
- Scope
    - __All computers__


### Step Two: Smart Group

__A smart group named “FileVault encryption key is invalid or unknown” selects the affected Macs.__

| And/Or |               Criteria                |       Operator       |              Value              |
| :----: | :-----------------------------------: | :------------------: | :-----------------------------: |
|        | FileVault 2 Individual Key Validation |        is not        |              Valid              |
|  and   |             Last Check-in             | less than x days ago |               30                |
|  and   |     FileVault 2 Detailed Status*      |          is          | FileVault 2 Encryption Complete |

### Step Three: Script

__The reissue_filevault_recovery_key.sh script runs on each affected Mac.__

- Start by customizing the __reissue_filevault_recovery_key.sh__ script as needed for your environment.
    - __Email__ affected employees to give them a heads up.
    - Use __jamfHelper__ to announce the upcoming password prompt.
    - Add __logo__ to AppleScript password prompt.
    - __Fail silently__ if logo files aren’t present, or any other problems detected.
    - __Verify__ the Mac login password, with 5 chances to enter correct password.

Here is the section of the script you'll want to customize:

### Step Four: Policy

__A policy called “Reissue invalid or missing FileVault recovery key” runs the script on each Mac in the smart group.__

- General
    - Trigger: __Recurring Check-In__
    - Execution Frequency: __Once per computer__
- Packages
    - __AppleScriptCustomIcon.dmg__ (loads /tmp/Pinterest.icns)
- Scripts
    - __reissue_filevault_recovery_key.sh__ (priority: __After__)
- Scope
    - Smart Group: __FileVault encryption key is invalid or unknown__


### Follow Through

__Don’t forget to monitor policy logs and test FileVault recovery to verify success.__

- Monitor logs and flush one-off errors. (Unable to connect to distribution point, no user logged in, etc.)
- Identify and resolve remaining problems manually.
- Test a few newly-generated FileVault keys to ensure they are working as expected.
- Update your internal documentation.


__Thank you!__
